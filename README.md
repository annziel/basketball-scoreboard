### Short description:
My first solo project during the Learn JavaScript for free Course on Scrimba. I love it so much! I discovered that browsers have default stylesheets, so my app may not look as I wrote it. Another new thing was that using a custom font requires declaring it in `.css`, and the safest way to do that is to host it on your site. I even added several new features and improved the provided design. Finally, I realized the power of the browser's developer tools when it comes to debugging.
	
### The original requirements:
- Follow the design featuring a custom font. That was my first time with Figma, and I liked it!
- Create six working buttons for score increments (home and guest team)
- Show the actual score of each team after every click

### My customizations:
I've met the stretch goals proposed by the teacher and added a leader highlight and a timer for 24sec team actions. These features were not explained during the course. Understanding `.js` concepts like `date` and scheduling actions with `setInterval()` was really challenging!
	
### Further development ideas:
- Create a period timer
- Add a period counter
- Responsiveness in the portrait mode

### How it looks like:
